# Note Taker

## Description

The note taker site is a way to store and retrieve notes.  The main page has a link to the notes page which will display all of the stored notes and a field to input a new note.  Once the title and text of the new note are entered, a save icon appears that allows you to save the new note with all the existing notes.  If one of the existing notes is clicked on, it will be displayed to the user.  If the + icon is selected then the user is again allowed to enter another new note.  There are trash can icons beside each existing note which will allow the user to remove that note from the list. The page can be found at [https://kunkelkevin-notetaker.herokuapp.com/](https://kunkelkevin-notetaker.herokuapp.com/)
